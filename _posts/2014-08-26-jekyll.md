1. Github can generate a personal site automatically: create a new repository and turn to setting page below which there is a botton 'generate github pages'.




2. Automatic generated pages have the style files which can be used in our own site.

3. Build my own site via jekyll : http://blog.csdn.net/on_1y/article/details/19259435. Note that if you are using your personal site, in other words project name is 'yourname.github.io', master branch is recoginzed by github otherwise you need to init your site in gh-pages branch.

4. Learn to use markdown: https://www.zybuluo.com/mdeditor?url=http://www.zybuluo.com/static/editor/md-help.markdown

5. If you want to use latex math equation, includes following in head in your layout file.

		<!-- MathJax Section Start -->
		
		<script type="text/javascript"
		src="http://cdn.mathjax.org/mathjax/latest/MathJax.js?config=TeX-AMS-MML_HTMLorMML">
		</script>
		<script>
		MathJax.Hub.Config({
			tex2jax: {
				skipTags: ['script', 'noscript', 'style', 'textarea', 'pre']
				}
		       	});
		       	MathJax.Hub.Queue(function() {
		           	var all = MathJax.Hub.getAllJax(), i;
		           	for(i=0; i < all.length; i += 1) {
		               	all[i].SourceElement().parentNode.className += ' has-jax';
		          	}
		       });
		</script>
		
		<!-- MathJax Section End -->
		
6. If you use redcarpet as your markdown explainer, '_' need to be convert into '\_', which is not very convenient for me. Kramdown is the origin explainer used by github which supports original latex equation format and github code highlight style. But pygments is not compatible with kramdown in jekyll ( I have tried to turn on the pygments in jekyll, but code still remains clean), kramdown use 'coderay' as its highlighter. If you want to use this feature, you need to have coderay library installed. In addition, the kramdown used by github does not support coderay, you need to generate you own static pages at first and then upload.
